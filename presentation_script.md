# Saadhya: Presentation Script

## Slide 1: Title Slide & Introduction
**Visuals:** Title slide with the Saadhya logo and project title: "Saadhya 👁️📚: An accessible, AI-powered online examination system."

**Speaker:** 
"Hello everyone, and thank you for being here. Today, I am excited to introduce you to **Saadhya**, a project born out of a critical need for accessibility in education. Saadhya is an innovative, AI-powered online examination system tailored specifically for students with visual and motor impairments."

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Visuals:** Points indicating the struggles of differently-abled students with traditional online testing formats (e.g., reliance on precise mouse-clicks, unreadable test formats).

**Speaker:** 
"Traditional online examination platforms are often designed with a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. This creates massive barriers for students who are visually impaired or those who have limited motor skills. Navigating through standard interfaces, clicking small radio buttons, or reading text-heavy screens can make it incredibly difficult—or even impossible—for them to take tests independently and fairly."

## Slide 3: Our Solution - Saadhya
**Visuals:** A high-level diagram or a mockup of the Saadhya interface showing the seamless, hands-free experience.

**Speaker:** 
"That’s where Saadhya comes in. We decided to bridge this gap by leveraging modern web technologies and computer vision to create a truly inclusive testing environment. By removing the dependency on standard keyboards and mice, Saadhya gives students the autonomy they deserve to focus on their exams without stressing over the interface."

## Slide 4: Core Features Breakdown
**Visuals:** Bullet points splitting functionality into Gesture Mode, Voice Mode, and Text-to-Speech. Small icons (✋, 🎤, 🔊) for each.

**Speaker:** 
"To achieve this, Saadhya operates on a system of dual-mode accessibility, ensuring we hit the specific needs of different users:
- First, we have **Gesture Mode** for students with visual impairments. Using cutting-edge AI hand-tracking, a student simply raises their fingers to the webcam to select an answer. One finger for Option A, two for Option B, and so on. A 'Thumbs Up' confirms and submits their answer.
- Second, we have **Voice Mode** for students with motor impairments. This allows students to navigate and answer questions completely hands-free using natural voice commands.
- Tying it together is our dynamic **Text-to-Speech** functionality. The system automatically reads out questions and options so the experience is entirely eyes-free."

## Slide 5: The Educator's Perspective (Admin Panel)
**Visuals:** Screenshot or mockup of the Admin Panel, emphasizing 'PDF/Excel Upload' and 'Student Data'.

**Speaker:** 
"An accessible system must also be easy for educators to manage. We've built a secure Admin Panel inside Saadhya. From here, administrators can manage registered students and effortlessly update the exam database. Instead of manually typing questions into a form, educators can simply upload an Excel or PDF document, and our backend seamlessly extracts and converts that data into an active exam format."

## Slide 6: The Technology Stack
**Visuals:** Logos of technologies used: Python, Flask, OpenCV, Google MediaPipe, JS/HTML/CSS.

**Speaker:** 
"Under the hood, Saadhya is powered by a robust and fast tech stack:
- On the backend, we use **Python and Flask** combined with WebSockets for real-time communication.
- To make the offline computer vision work instantly, we utilize **OpenCV** and the **Google MediaPipe Tasks API** for incredibly fast hand-landmark tracking right in the background.
- Finally, the frontend utilizes standard web technologies paired with native browser APIs like the **Web Speech API** for our voice recognition and synthesis."

## Slide 7: Conclusion & Future Outlook
**Visuals:** A summary statement and a "Thank You" or "Q&A" prompt.

**Speaker:** 
"In summary, Saadhya isn't just an examination application; it is an active step toward making digital education highly inclusive. We believe that technology should empower everyone, and through AI gesture tracking and voice synthesis, we have stripped away the physical barriers of digital exams. 

Thank you for your time. I would now be happy to give a live demonstration or answer any questions you might have."
